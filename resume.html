        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I began my career as a broadcast news photojournalist, and despite finding success in winning multiple awards for my work, I knew this wouldn't be the career for me. I wanted to learn more about the business side of the house and spent the next five years working in various sales roles, honing my negotiation skills and learning more about how businesses operate. While working as an account manager in the business technology sector I quickly realized that tech was what I wanted to do. Fast forward to today where I am a Customer Success Manager for a software company, and with any luck a web developer someday.

             Time has a way of slipping away from us. This inspired myself and team members from my UPENN Web Development Bootcamp to create ActivateMe. Log and view daily activities and utilize data visualizations to better understand where all that time is going.

I met regularly with customers to understand what was going well, what wasn't going well and how the overall experimentation program was tracking towards its goals. If needed, risk mitigation stategies were developed to set the program back on track.
