        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I started my career as a photojournalist working for WBRE-TV in Wilkes-Barre, PA and WHP-TV in Harrisburg, PA -  NBC and CBS networks respectively. Where I currently am at is rather different.
          <br><br>
          In my role as a Customer Success Manager for a marketing technology company (SaaS), my primary objective is to develop and strengthen the customer/vendor relationship. That is to say, make sure the customer is extracting value from the platform (their investment), and informed on other company offerings enabling growth on by sides of the partnership.
          <br><br>
          Where I hope to be is still a bit up in the air. This portfolio exists because I have always had an interest in web development going back to the early days of the internet. I&apos;m a builder and creator at heart but also a strategist and a planner. It may not be clear on where Iâ€™ll be in the months and years ahead, but I hope I&apos;m still doing those things.

          My portfolio is a work-in-progress, but have a look below at some of my past projects. There are links to the live site, as well as links to the Github repo where you will find additional details.

             Time has a way of slipping away from us. This inspired myself and team members from my UPENN Web Development Bootcamp to create ActivateMe. Log and view daily activities and utilize data visualizations to better understand where all that time is going.
