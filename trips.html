          <h2>Yosemite National Park</h2>
          <p>
            Considered by many to be the crown jewel of the U.S. National Park
            system, this park is many things. I spent about a week traveling
            around the park with no real plan other than to enjoy the park and
            not pressure myself to do and see everything. I'll break down my
            trip the Clint Eastwood way. The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly.
          </p>

            <section>
              <h3>The Good</h3>
              <p>
                Let me start by saying that the phrase "Don't believe the hype"
                had been in my head all along before visiting for my first and
                only time. Folks, the hype is real. Driving in from the west
                entrance and turning the corner to Tunnel View is incredible. If
                you live out west, you might be used to views like this, but not
                all views are equal, and this one stands out among them all for
                me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking down into the Yosemite Valley from high above, protected
                on both sides with giant walls of granite that serve as a
                playground to the world's best outdoor rock climbers is truly
                one of those magical National Park experiences.
              </p>
              <h3>The Bad</h3>
              <p>
                I have a hard time saying anything bad about our National Parks.
                Well, at least not the parks themselves. California and the
                western side of the United States have had no shortages of
                wildfires in recent years.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was optimistic this would not be an issue for me since I would
                be entering the park in October, thinking that the cooler
                weather might bring rain, cooler weather and this a smaller
                chance I would encounter fire related problems. This didn't turn
                out how I epxpected. Immediately upon entering the park, the
                smoke resembled a light fog that surrounded me and could be seen
                through the tops of the tress that towered to my right and left.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <h3>The Ugly</h3>
              <p>
                What the fuck did I do? ...Lester, are we still cops? OK, I was
                just checking. ...Explain it to me again, because I tell ya, I
                think I'm a smart guy, but this shit makes my head hurt. ...This
                kid, whose mama went to the trouble to christen him Omar Isaiah
                Betts... You know, he forgets his jacket, his nose starts
                running and some asshole, instead of giving him a Kleenex, he
                calls him "Snot". So he's Snot forever. Doesn't seem fair.
              </p>
              <p>
                See, that's what I don't get about the drug thing. Why can't you
                sell the shit and walk the fuck away? You know what I mean?
                Everything else in this country gets sold without people
                shooting each other behind it. ...I gotta tell you, Lester, I
                don't want to hurt your feelings, but I can see why Daniels
                cringed every time you opened your fucking mouth. You're a
                supervisor's nightmare. ...Well, you know what they say: "stupid
                criminals make stupid cops". I'm proud to be chasing this guy.
                Nah, it's not just that. It's like, I went to meet her once; she
                was in a hotel room on the top floor. I punched the button on
                the elevator and it doesn't even go there. You gotta have some
                kind of special key to even get to that special fucking floor.
                So I go to the front desk, some sneering fuck calls upstairs,
                gives me permission to go and get laid. I listen to the shit she
                talks about and it's the first time in my life I feel like a
                fucking doormat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like anyone else with any smarts would do something else with
                his life, you know? Earn money, or ... get elected. Like I'm
                just a breathing machine for my fucking dick. I'm serious; I'm
                the smartest asshole in three districts and she looks at me like
                I'm some stupid fuck playing some stupid game for stupid
                penny-ante stakes. She fucking looks through me, Kima.
